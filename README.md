# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Microsoft SSIS. The goal was to build automated workflows to extract data from multiple sources, clean and transform it, and load it into structured formats for analytical use.

Key Tasks Performed

1. Extracted data from multiple CSV files and loaded it into new CSV outputs through ETL workflows.
2. Combined and transformed data from multiple CSV sources, then pushed the results into SQL Server.
3. Integrated data from both CSV files and SQL Server, applied transformations, and automated loading using SQL Server Agent scheduling.
4. Created Star and Snowflake Schemas in SQL Server using the provided B1 dataset.
5. Utilized the AdventureWorks Data Warehouse to develop OLAP cubes in SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services).
6. Applied various multidimensional functions on the OLAP cubes for in-depth data analytics and reporting.
